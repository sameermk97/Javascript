GAME RULES:
</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">
 The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
 <br>
 In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. 
 <br>
 Each result get added to his ROUND score.
 <br>
 BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost.
 <br>
 After that, it's the next player's turn.
 <br>
 The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score.
 <br> 
 If you wish to hold then it will be the next player's turn,
 <br>
 The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
